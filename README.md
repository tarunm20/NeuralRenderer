# Monte Carlo Denoising
## Inspiration
During my CSE 168 class, we learned about building a Monte Carlo Path Tracer. It was super fun and cool to see vibrant and detailed images. However, rendering the scenes took too long, and there would still be significant noise in the scenes. Therefore, I wanted to build a Monte Carlo Denoiser using ML. 

## Plan
1) Render scenes with Mitsuba renderer.
2) Figure out which features I want to extract from the scene.
3) Collect data and create a dataset with the scenes provided.
4) Brainstorm models that have been implemented and see what I can work on.
5) Implement model in Pytorch -> I still want to learn more about PyTorch, so I am considering implementing a simple transformer model.
6) Develop my model and train it on the dataset that I developed with the renderer.
7) Profit
