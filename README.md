# NeuralRenderer

## Inspiration
The last assignment in my CSE 167 class was to build a ray tracer. My partner and I procrastinated till the last 2 days of the project time. After completing our work we had to render specific scenes, but they took way too long. We almost didn't submit our output. After the quarter I kept thinking of how we could improve the speed. Immediately I thought of neural networks.

## Plan
1) Develop standard raytracer
2) Generate data from raytracer for NN
3) Develop NN
4) Format data from raytracer to feed into NN
5) Hyperparameter tuning
6) profit

## Raytracer
In class, we learned to make the raytracer using C++. However, I'm more comfortable with Python, and implementing it would be simpler. Since I am not focusing on the raytracer's actual performance, the language shift shouldn't be an issue.

## Neural Network
I think the biggest challenge here is to find a way to feed the raytracer data into a NN. I'm going to have to do some research and experiment a little on the data that I could feed into the NN. Developing the actual NN shouldn't be too bad. I'll use MSE on each RGB value per pixel. I'll be using Python to develop the model.

## Goal
My goal is to be able to recreate a scene generated by a raytracer with 95% accuracy. This accuracy is just an arbitrary number, but a first-try accuracy of 60%~70% would be ideal.
